**Welcome to Contrasleuth &mdash; a potent communication tool**

For non-native (and non-) speakers of English: the name is pronounced as /ˈkɒntrəsluːθ/. The first syllable is stressed.

Contrasleuth's ambition is to be the largest unmanaged wireless ad hoc network in the world. You are allowed to send small, expiring pieces of data to one or multiple recipients. When a node receives some data, it stores that piece of data in its inventory. The inventory reconciliation process is run continually to make sure every inventory gets consistent eventually. The network has abuse prevention mechanisms (currently proof of work) to prevent you from flooding the network with lots of data. **We are aware that most software eventually phases out proof of work as an abuse busting measure.**

The Contrasleuth app functions similarly to an email client. You can send messages to a person or a group with or without the Internet and have them automatically sent to the recipient(s) as quickly as possible. The messages are marshalled in a neat way to provide the best communication experience.

The app is a battery hog but we hope you won't mind. This is still experimental technology. When this piece of tech gets more attention, hopefully the platform will provide some features to improve battery efficiency for this kind of app.
